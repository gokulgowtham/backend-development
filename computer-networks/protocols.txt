Certain set of rules, everythign needs to go by step by step.
Network Protocols ---> set of rules/regulations set up to commmunicate over a network. 

Packets : 
In order to share data, we cant send big chunk of data over the network, 

we divide data to be sent into smaller chunks or packets.

Address: 
Sending msgs or packets over the network requires the destination details of the end system, this detail uniquely identifies the system. 
this is called IP Address

Ports: 
Any machine coule be running many network apps, in order to distinguish these apps for receiving messages, we use ports (port number). 
it helps to get the packets to specific process or location.

IP address + Port  ---> Socket 

Every process has 16 bit port number (0- 2^16) ->65535 

0-1023 --> well known port (reserved for apps)

1024 - 49152 -> Registered ports (THey are used by specific , potentially proprietary 3rd party apps/ process that are known but not system defined. 
SQL server --> 1433


491542 - 65535 --> dynamic ports. (future purposess )

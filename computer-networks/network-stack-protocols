2 MAjor standards --> OSI (7 layers)
TCP/IP (5 layers)


OSI protocol stack 
1. Application -> email service, chat service. 
2. Presentation -> how data is represented, compressed, encrypted.
3. Session -> any user session mgmt
4. Transport layer -> divides big chunk of data to small chunks and amnaging these chunks. 
5. Network layer -> how routing of packets will be done. 
6. Data layer -> Error / flow controll. multiplexing/ demultiplexing, handle addressng. 
7. Physica layer  -> cable/satellite connections. 

TCP/IP Protocol stack (5 Layers):
1. Application (3 combined in to 1 )
2. Transporrt layer
3. Network layer 
4. Data Layer 
5. Phsycial 



Application Layer 

Roles:
1. Writing / Providing data off to the network. 
2. Reading and writing the data from the user. 
3. Contains applications that helpes user to interact on network. 


Client / Server Architecture. 
2 Level architecture, 
Servers -> This Process controls access to a centralized resource pr service such as website/webapp. 

P2P architecture, multiple end systems are connected to each other (decentralized system)

Hybrid -> combination of client-server and P2P architecuture.
